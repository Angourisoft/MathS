### What should I do?

You do not have to do anything, so any your contribution is up to you. Nonetheless, you can grab a card-issue from ![tasks](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/projects) and complete one. That would boost a new release, that is, a valuable contribution. There are also ![issues](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues), so you can check them instead.

### Where do I get the documentation for contributors?

You might have some questions about the way you should write your code, or how you could call a function, etc. It is recommended to check the ![documentation](./AngouriMath/Docs/Contributing).

### Rules for contributors?

Obviously, keeping civil and polite is quite essential. Other than that, there are some ![rules](./AngouriMath/Docs/Contributing/coding_rules.md) regarding patterns and concepts followed in AngouriMath.
