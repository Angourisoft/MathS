If you want to contribute to the parser, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your machine
2. Change the file ./AngouriMath/Core/FromString/Antlr/AngouriMath.g (other source files in the Antlr folder are generated from this file)
3. Run `start ./AngouriMath/antlr_rerun.bat` or `./AngouriMath/antlr_rerun.bat` to regenerate the parser via ANTLR
4. Observe that other source files in the Antlr folder have been updated
